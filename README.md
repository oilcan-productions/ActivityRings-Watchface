# ActivityRings-Watchface

Activity Rings Clock Face for Fitbit Sense.
This is my first watch face and it is still growing.
It shows the the day of the week and date as well as the time, battery and charging status, weather for the current location, activity rings for daily activity. In the bottom center region you can use the companion app to set a second time zone and a short name for for that time zone if desired. It also shows the heart rate.
Tapping the weather info will open the Fitbit weather app if it is installed.
